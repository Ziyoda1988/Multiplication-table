# Instructions  

  ** Using Scanner class, create a program that takes the input as an integer and dipslays the multiplication table for that number up to 10.
  
  (In Java, multiplication operator is  * )
  
  Your code needs be dynamic, that is, it needs to work for any input value.
  
  So if the input is 7, your code displays multiplication table for 7, if it is 23 it needs to display multiplication table for 23 and so on.
  
  The examples of some console outputs are given below.
  **

  ## Example output 1

  Please enter a number: 
  
  5

  Here's the multiplication table for 5:

  5 x 1 = 5
  
  5 x 2 = 10
  
  5 x 3 = 15
  
  5 x 4 = 20
  
  5 x 5 = 25
  
  5 x 6 = 30
  
  5 x 7 = 35
  
  5 x 8 = 40
  
  5 x 9 = 45
  
  5 x 10 = 50


  

  ## Example output 2

  Please enter a number: 
  
  9

  Here's the multiplication table for 9:

  9 x 1 = 9
  
  9 x 2 = 18
  
  9 x 3 = 27
  
  9 x 4 = 36
  
  9 x 5 = 45
  
  9 x 6 = 54
  
  9 x 7 = 63
  
  9 x 8 = 72
  
  9 x 9 = 81
  
  9 x 10 = 90


  ## Example output 3

  Please enter a number: 
  
  23

  Here's the multiplication table for 9:

  23 x 1 = 23
  
  23 x 2 = 46
  
  23 x 3 = 69
  
  23 x 4 = 92
  
  23 x 5 = 115
  
  23 x 6 = 138
  
  23 x 7 = 161
  
  23 x 8 = 184
  
  23 x 9 = 207
  
  23 x 10 = 230
